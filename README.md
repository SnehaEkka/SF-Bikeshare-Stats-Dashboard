# SF Bikeshare Stats Dashboard

A vibrant, interactive Tableau dashboard capturing the pulse of San Francisco’s bikeshare movement—crafted for BA775 (Spring 2025) and designed for all who want to unlock urban mobility trends. This project showcases how thoughtful visualization transforms massive trip data into actionable insights for planners, marketers, and everyday riders alike.

## Project Background

How do riders use bikeshare in San Francisco and the Bay Area? What can citizen data reveal about city rhythms, popular landmarks, and the habits of loyal subscribers versus one-time customers?  
Leveraging millions of ride records from BigQuery public datasets (`san_francisco.bikeshare_trips` and related tables), this dashboard transforms numbers into a dynamic urban story, analyzing not just what’s busy, but *who* rides, *where*, and *when*.

## Skills & Tools Demonstrated
- Exploratory and comparative data analysis  
- Interactive dashboard design and user experience in Tableau  
- Effective use of filters, drilldowns, and user-driven storytelling  
- Data wrangling & aggregation for visual insights  
- Visual encoding and dashboard usability for diverse audiences  

**Tools:**  
- Tableau Public (dashboard construction & publishing)  
- Google BigQuery Public Datasets (bikeshare trip data)

## Dashboard Highlights

- **Landmark & Station Mapping:**  
  Instantly spot the hottest hubs across San Francisco, San Jose, and Peninsula cities. Bubble sizes scale with trip volume, letting you visualize urban hotspots and travel corridors at a glance.

- **Powerful Filters:**  
  Tailor your view by landmark and subscriber type (Customer vs. Subscriber), revealing remarkably different patterns hidden beneath the totals.

- **Time Series Deep Dives:**  
  - *Monthly Trends*: See how ridership surges with the seasons, reflecting weather, events, or city policy.  
  - *Weekly Patterns*: Which days fuel the most activity (hint: weekends roar with riders!)?

- **Station Leaderboards:**  
  - *Top Start & End Stations*: Ranked bars display the busiest points to grab or drop a bike, segmented by subscriber type.  
  - *Pie & Color Legends*: At a glance, see the composition and leading contributors in every viz.

- **Subscriber Type Insights:**  
  Analyze how loyal subscribers vs. casual customers interact with landmarks, empowering cities to better target growth, retention, and resource optimization strategies.

## Why This Matters

This dashboard is more than a playground for the data-obsessed; it’s a city planning toolkit and a rider’s roadmap.

- **For City Planners:**  
  - Identify where to expand or rebalance stations for maximum impact.  
  - Time seasonal maintenance, upgrades, and marketing to match demand spikes.  
  - Track subscriber engagement for deeper program success.

- **For Marketers & Program Managers:**  
  - Pinpoint which landmarks and days spark organic ridership, then double down.  
  - Segment campaigns by subscriber type for smarter messaging.

- **For Riders:**  
  - Beat the rush by choosing quieter times and stations.  
  - Discover new destinations fueled by bikeshare popularity and trends.
